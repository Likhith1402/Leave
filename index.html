            <p>Dear Surya,</p>

            <p>I am writing to formally request leave from 21/08/2024 to 23/08/2024. The reason for my leave is to attend my sister marriage .</p>

            <p>I have ensured that my current tasks are completed or delegated appropriately, and I am confident that my absence will not disrupt the workflow. Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any specific arrangements you would like me to make before my leave.</p>

            <p>Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your approval.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>
